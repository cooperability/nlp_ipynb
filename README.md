# nlp_ipynb
These Python notebooks serve as a ground-up educational resource to work through NLP from the ground up. Also included are sets of python and NLP templates to be used piecemeal in my other projects. This repo is a hybridization of Stanford course learnings, personal research, and my condensed notes from the "NLP-Natural Language Processing with Python" course by Jose Portilla with Pierian Data. I've attempted to make the learning flow naturally between MY phases of learning NLP. This won't work for everyone.
